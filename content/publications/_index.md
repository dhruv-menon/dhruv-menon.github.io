in science, writing is the [*'only thing we do that matters'*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02584-1). i spend a great deal of time thinking and writing - and as a consequence, i'm quite active in publishing my work. while my articles generally focus on **computational aspects** of materials discovery & design for **drug delivery**, **gas capture & separation**, and **catalysis**, i also publish reviews & commentaries on *broader aspects* of biology, energy & environment. 

i try to write in ways that are accessible to general audiences (and feel that i'm getting better at it with time). in case you aren't able to access my papers for whatever reason, drop me an email at *dm958[at]cam[dot]ac[dot]uk*. 


###### Make metal-organic frameworks safe and sustainable by design for industrial translation
*Nature Reviews Materials, 2025*    

emphasizes adopting a *"safe and sustainable by design"* approach to develop robust, recyclable MOFs that ensure functionality, environmental safety, and alignment with circular economy principles.

###### Rational design of metal-organic frameworks for pancreatic cancer therapy: from machine learning screen to in vivo efficacy
*Advanced Materials, 2025*

machine learning-guided selection of the MOF PCN-222, loaded with paclitaxel and administered via hydrogel, significantly reduces pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis in mice compared to free drug treatments.

###### Guiding the rational design of biocompatible metal-organic frameworks for drug delivery
*Matter, 2025*

a machine learning-driven pipeline that screens 86,000 MOFs to identify low-toxicity candidates and derives design rules for safe, clinically translatable frameworks by analyzing precursor molecule toxicity.

###### Flexibility-frustrated porosity for enhanced selective CO2 adsorption in an ultramicroporous metal-organic framework
*Chem, 2025*

restricting pore flexibility in a MOF architecture improves CO₂/N₂ selectivity by enhancing size-sieving effects through ultra-narrow pores (~3.6 Å) optimized for kinetic gas separation.
