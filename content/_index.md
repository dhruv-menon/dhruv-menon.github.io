title: "molecular design & engineering"
draft: false
---
i'm a **molecular architect** *(of sorts)*, developing advanced computational tools for the *discovery & design* of new **materials & molecules**, with an emphasis on their applications in *medicine*, *energy*, and related fields. i do *(sometimes)* enjoy engaging with **translational aspects** of my research.

i'm currently a **phd student** in chemical engineering & biotechnology at the *university of cambridge*. prior to this, i got my **masters in physics** from the *cavendish laboratory* at cambridge, and an **undergraduate degree** from the *indian institute of technology gandhinagar*. 

despite my *(fair)* share of problems with academia, i'm particularly drawn to science and all the baggage that it carries, and as such am quite active in sharing my work and ideas. some day however, i may leave all this behind to open a cafe. 

curious about my work? check out my [publications](publications/) & [notes]('notebook/'). the part-time philosopher in me is also a bit of an archivist, find some of my thoughts on science & life [here]('reflections/') - but only if you promise not to get offended.
